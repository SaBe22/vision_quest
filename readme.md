# Welcome to Vision Quest
This repository provides a collection of simple and easy-to-use PyTorch implementations of various vision models.

### Implemented models:

* **Vision Transformers (ViT)**: Vision transformers implementations inspired by ["An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929) paper.
* **Masked Autoencoders (MAE)**: Unsupervised learning with MAE models based on ["Masked Autoencoders Are Scalable Vision Learners"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.06377)

Stay tuned for more! I'm constantly expanding my collection to include new and exciting vision models.
